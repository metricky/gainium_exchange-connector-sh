/**
 * Unit-level repro for bug #385 — the Coinbase Unauthorized retry ladder.
 *
 * `handleCoinbaseErrors` treated a 401 `Unauthorized` as a retryable condition
 * and ran the full `this.retry = 10` attempts at a flat 2s sleep each. A
 * revoked / expired / wrong-type key cannot become valid by asking again, so
 * every one of those attempts was pure waiting: ~18s per call, then the same
 * `NOTOK / Unauthorized` it could have returned at once.
 *
 * Production consequence: main-app's `updateUserBalance` refreshes EVERY stored
 * connection on a portfolio refresh, and its worker pool waits for all of them,
 * so ONE dead Coinbase connection set the wall clock of the whole
 * `updateBalance` GraphQL resolver. That surfaced as
 * `[SlowGraphQL] op=updateBalance ms=19442..19742` sustained over several
 * minutes, in the same 19.3-20.8s band on every affected account — all of
 * which hold a Coinbase connection already flagged `status: false`. The
 * connector logged the ladder verbatim: `Coinbase Unauthorized wait 2000s 1`
 * … `9`, at high volume.
 *
 * Run: `npm test` (mocha).
 *
 * No network / auth needed — the Coinbase REST client is stubbed.
