/**
 * Unit-level repro for bug #181 — "Kraken EGeneral:Too many requests on
 * getCandles saturating all six nodes".
 *
 * Kraken's *public* (per-IP) rate limit is returned as HTTP **200** with the
 * code in the body:
 *   {"error":["EGeneral:Too many requests"],"httpStatus":200}
 * getCandles turns that into `throw new Error('EGeneral:Too many requests')`.
 *
 * Pre-fix that string was in neither `retryErrors` nor the `isRateLimit` set, so
 * `shouldRetry` was false: the call failed instantly with no backoff and the
 * archive backfiller immediately re-requested. Prod node 40 showed 142 of 145
 * error lines with this signature and **zero** "Retrying after" lines.
 *
 * Run: npx ts-node --files --project tsconfig.json \
 *        src/exchange/exchanges/kraken/rate-limit.spec.ts
 *
 * No network / auth needed — it drives handleKrakenErrors with a stub callback.
