## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Bitget futures balance

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Self-hosted admin-config sync (gated by `ADMIN_CONFIG_ENABLED`). Reads
  `gainium:admin:enabled_exchanges` from Redis, subscribes to
  `gainium:admin:config` pubsub for sub-second propagation, and runs a
  10s periodic refresh as a safety net for dropped messages. When the
  flag is off (cloud / unflagged deployments) every code path is a hard
  no-op — no Redis connection opened, no timers, no log lines.
