/**
 * Hyperliquid has no permissioned API key — the credential IS a wallet private
 * key — so the withdrawal question becomes "whose key is this?".
 *
 * An **API (agent) wallet** can only trade; HL blocks it from withdrawing or
 * transferring. The **master** key can do everything. `getAccountRole()`
 * already guards the *address* field against agent/master confusion, but the
 * `secret` was never validated: nothing stopped a user pasting their master
 * private key, which hands Gainium a credential with full withdrawal power —
 * exactly the exposure the withdrawal-permission work exists to remove.
 *
 * `getKeyPermissions()` derives the signer from the secret using the SDK's own
 * `getWalletAddress` (the same derivation used when signing an order) and
 * compares it with the account address.
 *
 * Run: `npm test` (mocha).
 *
 * Offline: derivation is local, and no info/exchange call is made.
