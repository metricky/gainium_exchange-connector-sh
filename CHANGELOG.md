## [Unreleased]

## [1.19.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Kraken signed REST requests now draw their nonce from a per-API-key counter shared across the whole process, instead of the SDK's per-client-instance one. Kraken requires the nonce for a key to strictly increase, and `@siebly/kraken-api` seeds `apiRequestNonce` as a field initialiser on each client — a guard that only covers requests sharing one instance. The connector builds a fresh exchange, and therefore a fresh `SpotClient`/`DerivativesClient`, for every request, so two concurrent calls on one key each read the same millisecond and emitted an identical nonce: Kraken accepted one and rejected the other with `EAPI:Invalid nonce`. This is the same defect Hyperliquid had (fixed 2026-07-14 with `hyperliquid/nonce.ts`); Kraken was given only the matching `retryErrors` entries at the time, which masked the collisions instead of preventing them, at the cost of a retry ladder on the affected calls. Note this closes the same-process window only — instances are separate processes and do not share the counter.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `GET /marginAvailableUsd` reports the USD margin available on pooled-collateral futures accounts, implemented for Kraken Futures' flex (`multiCollateralMarginAccount`) and defaulting to `null` — "no opinion" — on every other venue and account type. Kraken pools all collateral currencies into one cross-margin account, so a wallet funded only in EUR can still margin a USD-quoted perpetual; the per-currency balances from `/balance` show no USD at all in that case, which reads as an empty account to anything sizing off the quote asset. This is deliberately a separate endpoint rather than a synthetic entry in `/balance`: that list is also summed to value a user's portfolio, so publishing the pooled USD figure there next to the per-currency holdings would count the same money twice. Callers must treat `null` as "fall back to the quote-asset balance".

## [1.18.4] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- A declared IP allowlist can now only ever prove the positive: a populated list answers `yes`, and empty, absent **or an explicit `*` wildcard** all answer `unknown`. 1.18.3 still treated `['*']` as the exchange affirmatively stating "any IP" and returned `no`. That was wrong, and measurably so — Bybit emits `['*']` rather than `[]`, so of 443 credentials re-probed after 1.18.3 shipped, **441 came back `no`**: the change accomplished nothing for the exchange that motivated it. A wildcard is not a claim that the key is unrestricted; it means the key's own allowlist is empty, which is equally true of a key bound through the connect-a-third-party-app flow where the binding lives on the exchange's side. Such keys report `['*']` and still reject calls from unpublished addresses. The cost is deliberate: `ipRestricted` is now effectively binary (`yes`/`unknown`) and no key can be declared unprotected from this field alone — establishing that requires the two-sided capability probe. Binance is unaffected and can still answer `no`, because it declares `ipRestrict` as an explicit boolean rather than an allowlist to be inferred from.

## [1.18.3] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- An empty IP allowlist now answers `unknown` on **every** exchange, not just Bybit. 1.18.2 kept `'no'` for a present-but-empty field on OKX and Bitget on the reasoning that an empty field is the exchange affirmatively reporting no allowlist. That reasoning was wrong: OKX ("Linking third-party apps") and Bitget offer the same connect-a-third-party-app flow as Bybit, which provisions the key and configures its IP binding on the exchange's side, where it does not appear in the key's own allowlist. A key created that way is genuinely bound, reports an empty allowlist, and still rejects calls from outside its binding. Gainium's own connection guides steer users into that flow, so these are the common case rather than an edge case. An empty allowlist therefore cannot distinguish "unrestricted" from "restricted somewhere not visible here", and is not evidence either way. A populated list remains a reliable positive and an explicit `['*']` wildcard remains a reliable negative.

## [1.18.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- An empty IP allowlist is no longer read as "this key is unrestricted". The parsers previously flattened three different situations into `[]` and answered `ipRestricted: 'no'` for all of them: an allowlist the exchange reported as empty, a field the exchange omitted entirely, and — on Bybit — an allowlist that is empty in the API response while the key is in fact bound, because bindings made through Bybit's third-party-app flow are held on Bybit's side rather than in the key's own allowlist. A key in that last state reads empty here and still answers `10010 Unmatched IP` when called from an address outside its binding. The three are now distinguished: a populated list is `'yes'`, an explicit `['*']` wildcard is `'no'`, a present-but-empty field is `'no'`, an absent field is `'unknown'`, and for Bybit an empty list is `'unknown'` as well. Bitget (`ips`) and OKX (`ip`) no longer synthesise `[]` for a missing field. This follows the rule the module is built on — a parser that cannot tell must answer `unknown`, never `no` — and removes a false negative that reported IP-bound keys as unprotected.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Bitget: `wtow` is no longer treated as a withdrawal authority. The code was inferred rather than documented, and the authority sets returned by live keys contradict it — Bitget makes IP-binding mandatory on withdrawal-enabled keys, yet keys carrying `wtow` are markedly *less* likely to be IP-bound than keys without it, the opposite of what a real withdrawal permission would produce. Since main-app refuses a new connection whose key reports `withdraw: 'yes'`, this was wrongly turning away legitimate Bitget connections, citing a permission the key did not have. `chow`, the other plausible candidate, shows the same inverted pattern and is likewise not withdrawal; neither is added to the known-non-withdrawal list, since ruling a code out is not the same as knowing what it grants, so their keys still resolve to `unknown`.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Withdrawal-permission detection for exchange API keys. `getKeyPermissions()` reports what a key is allowed to do — withdrawal, internal transfer, IP allowlist — per exchange (Binance `apiRestrictions`, Bybit `query-api`, KuCoin `user/api-key`, OKX `account/config`, Bitget `spot/account/info`, Coinbase `key_permissions`, Kraken via a `WithdrawMethods` probe). Gainium only ever needs read + trade, and withdrawal is never required by any feature; until now nothing verified that a stored key was actually limited that way.
- `VerifyResponse.permissions` (optional, additive) and a new `GET /keyPermissions` endpoint for periodic re-auditing without running a full verification.
- Hyperliquid: detect a pasted **master** private key. An API/agent wallet key can only trade, a master key can withdraw; the account address was validated but the secret never was. The signer address is now derived with the SDK's own `getWalletAddress` and compared against the account.

### Notes

- Every state is tri-state; `unknown` never means `no`. The probe runs concurrently with verification, cannot change a verify verdict, and rejects nothing — reject-vs-flag policy lives in main-app, which knows whether a connection is new.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- OKX Europe X-Perp futures (instType=FUTURES, ruleType=xperp) on the okxLinear rail for okxSource=my: instFamily->instId symbol translation with expiry-roll cache, account-scoped `GET /exchange/account/futures` instrument endpoint, `okxsource` on `GET /exchange/all`, X-Perp candles/tickers/funding on keyless clients, and X-Perp tickers merged into the futures price list. Contributed by community member discord2020 (forum topic 4925).

## [1.16.9] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Kraken: the public (per-IP) rate limit is now retried with backoff instead of failing instantly (bug #181).** Kraken returns its public-endpoint limit as HTTP **200** with `{"error":["EGeneral:Too many requests"]}` in the body, so it matched neither the spot/futures strings in `retryErrors` nor the numeric `httpStatus` entries — `shouldRetry` was always false. Every rejected `/public/OHLC` call returned `NOTOK` immediately and the market-archive backfiller simply re-requested, so the six-node egress fleet hammered Kraken continuously instead of riding the limit out: prod node 40 logged 142 of 145 error lines with this signature and **zero** `Retrying after` lines, leaving candle backfill gapped and burying every other error on those nodes. The code is now in `retryErrors` and gets the same slow rate-limit pacing (3 attempts, 30s apart) as `EAPI:Rate limit exceeded`. It deliberately does **not** trigger `noteRateLimited()`: that downgrades an *account's* private REST tier, and a per-IP public rejection says nothing about any account's private budget. Covered by `src/exchange/exchanges/kraken/rate-limit.spec.ts`.

## [1.16.8] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **Kraken spot verify now rejects keys missing the "WebSocket interface" permission (issue #167 / ClickUp 86eyep5au).** Such a key passes the REST balance probe, so the connection looked healthy while the user-stream connector's `GetWebSocketsToken` call was rejected with `EGeneral:Permission denied` forever (16 users on 07-28) — the user was never told and their bots silently fell back to delayed reconcile-sweep-only fill delivery. `verifyKraken` now calls the new `Kraken.verifyWebsocketPermission()` (a `GetWebSocketsToken` probe) after the balance check and fails with a user-facing reason naming the exact Kraken setting to enable, following the Hyperliquid agent-address guard precedent. Only a definite `EGeneral:Permission denied` rejects; transient errors (rate limit, 5xx) never block verification. Spot-only — Kraken Futures WS auth signs a challenge with the key itself and has no separate permission.

### Fixed

- **Kraken: retries no longer re-invoke the method with garbled arguments.** `handleKrakenErrors` retries with `cb.call(this, ...args)`, but 19 call sites passed only the timeProfile — so any retryable Kraken error re-called the method with the TimeProfile object in the first parameter slot (`symbol`/`order`), surfacing as unhandled `TypeError: ourSymbol.replace is not a function` 500s (prod: `latestPrice` since June, `getCandles` on 2026-07-28 via WLFI-USD@krakenUsdm). Every call site now forwards the wrapped method's full argument list, matching the already-correct `getFundingRateHistory`/`futures_changeMarginType` sites.

## [1.16.6] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`src/exchange/helpers/symbolCodec.ts` — the single home for pair-symbol format knowledge** (Phase 1 of the symbol-format cleanup behind bug #153). Defines the canonical dashed `BASE-QUOTE` form and the adapter contract: resolve wire symbols through the asset map in one place per adapter, never fabricate a wire symbol on a lookup miss (return `null` → one-attempt `NOTOK Unknown pair`), and pass already-wire symbols through unchanged. Fallback-on-miss is only permitted while the asset map itself is unavailable, so a transient refresh outage degrades instead of hard-failing.

### Fixed

- **Hyperliquid: the two remaining fabrication holes now reject unknown symbols in one attempt instead of retrying HL's `500/null` for ~93s.** The 1.16.5 fix covered futures `getCandles` only; spot `getCandles` still passed an unknown pair through unchanged, and `getFundingRateHistory`'s coin lookup fell back to `split('-')[0]` — both forwarded fabricated coins to Hyperliquid. Both now resolve strictly (`resolveSpotCoin` / `resolveFuturesCoin`) and return `NOTOK Unknown Hyperliquid pair <symbol>` immediately. Verified against the live public API: pair, wire-coin and code forms all still return data (candles futures+spot, funding); compact forms reject in ≤1ms.

## [1.16.4] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **`getFundingRateHistory` now accepts our normalized pair on Hyperliquid and Kraken Futures instead of failing on it forever.** The funding registry can hold either the exchange's own symbol or our pair form, but both connectors assumed the exchange form: Hyperliquid passed the symbol straight in as `coin` (every other info call converts via `getCoinNameByPair`), so `BTC-USDC` got an HTTP 500 from the info API and surfaced as `NOTOK`; Kraken Futures passed it straight through as `symbol`, so `BTC-USD` got `[400] Argument invalid: symbol`. Both now normalize first — Hyperliquid via the existing (idempotent) coin lookup, Kraken only for dash-bearing symbols, since futures codes never contain one — so an already-correct symbol is untouched. Verified against the live public endpoints: HL `BTC-USDC` 500 vs `BTC` 267 rows; Kraken `BTC-USD` 400 vs `PF_XBTUSD` success.

## [1.16.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Kraken Futures: a partially- or fully-filled resting order is no longer reported as `NEW`, which was causing the bot to re-buy the same size at the same price (forum #4924).** Kraken Futures reports a resting order with a raw status of `ENTERED_BOOK` / `partiallyFilled` / `untouched` even when `filled > 0`. `getOrderStatus` (primary) and `getAllOpenOrders` passed that raw status straight into `mapOrderStatus`, which lacked the Futures statuses (only spot `"partially filled"` with a space existed) so everything fell through to `NEW`. main-app keys off `PARTIALLY_FILLED`/`FILLED`, so the fill was never recorded and the bot opened the position again. Both futures paths now derive the status from `executedQty` vs `origQty` via a new `futures_deriveOrderStatus` helper (mirroring the `getOrderEvents` fallback: a terminal cancel/reject wins, otherwise fill-derived), and `mapOrderStatus` gained the Futures raw statuses plus an idempotent `PARTIALLY_FILLED` mapping so a derived status survives the re-map in `futures_convertOrder`. Unit repro: `src/exchange/exchanges/kraken/partial-fill.spec.ts` (10 assertions).

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **Hyperliquid: a persistent `clearinghouseState` 429 no longer crashes the whole connector process.** When the short-TTL clearinghouseState cache is enabled (`HL_CH_STATE_CACHE_MS>0`, set to `1500` in prod), `HyperliquidChStateCache.track()` registered the in-flight fetch with `void p.finally(cleanup)`. `.finally()` returns a *new* promise that re-raises `p`'s rejection; that derived chain had no `.catch()`, so although the primary consumer (`await run` in `fetchClearinghouseState`, caught by the balance/positions fan-out) handled the error, the floating finally-chain surfaced it as an **unhandled rejection** — which Node ≥15 turns into a process exit. A sustained Hyperliquid rate-limit therefore killed the connector (pm2 auto-restarted it), cascading into main-app `balance … hyperliquidLinear` Internal Server Errors, `[Funding] NOTOK`, and market-archive backfill failures for that venue. The retry/backoff added in 1.15.x did not prevent this: it fires *before* the final rejection, and the crash came from the exhausted-retry rejection escaping via the un-caught finally-chain. `track()` now swallows the finally-chain rejection (`.finally(cleanup).catch(() => {})`); the real error is still handled by the awaiting consumer. Bug only manifests with the cache enabled (prod), which is why it never reproduced in local dev (cache defaults OFF).

## [1.15.11] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **Kraken: rate-limit rejections now retry 3x with 30s spacing instead of 10x with <=10s backoff.** `EAPI:Rate limit exceeded` / `apiLimitExceeded` shared the generic retry policy (10 attempts, exponential backoff capped at 10s), so under sustained per-account saturation every throttled call spawned up to 10 more requests while Kraken's counter only decays at ~0.33-0.5/s -- amplifying the storm (2026-07-14: ~2.3k logged rate-limit errors fleet-wide in 4h). Rate-limit-class errors now get at most 3 attempts spaced 30s apart (sized to the counter decay); all other retryable errors keep the existing policy. Retries still re-enter `checkLimits`, preserving local budget accounting.

## [1.15.10] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Kraken `getAllOpenOrders` no longer throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')` when called without a symbol. Every other connector treats `getAllOpenOrders(symbol?)` as "all open orders for the account" when the symbol is omitted (e.g. the fill-failsafe reconciliation path calls it with no symbol), and the connector's own HTTP layer declares `symbol` optional — but the Kraken implementation required it and unconditionally ran `toKrakenSymbol(symbol)`, so an undefined symbol reached `String.prototype.replace` in the symbol mapper and crashed. The crash was caught by `handleKrakenErrors` and returned as an error result, so Kraken open-order polling **failed silently** for affected accounts (bot could not see its open orders → risk of missed/duplicate order logic) rather than crash-looping. Kraken now honors the connector-family contract: with no symbol it returns all open orders (skips the per-symbol filter), and only maps+filters when a symbol is given. Both spot and futures branches are fixed.

### Changed

- `KrakenSymbolMapper.toKrakenSymbol` / `toOurSymbol` now return `''` for undefined/empty input instead of throwing on `.replace()` — a defensive guard for the mapper's ~30 call sites (widest-blast-radius `core/` code).
- `handleKrakenErrors` now distinguishes connector-side JS faults (`TypeError`/`ReferenceError`/`RangeError`/`SyntaxError` with no error body/response) from genuine Kraken API rejections: they log as `Kraken connector error (<name>)` with a stack instead of masquerading as `Kraken API error`, so log-triage can tell a code bug from an exchange rejection.

## [1.15.9] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid signed actions no longer fail with `invalid nonce: duplicate nonce` under concurrent same-signer requests. The connector builds a fresh `ExchangeClient` per request, so the SDK's per-client nonce counter never spanned concurrent requests — two actions in the same millisecond emitted an identical `Date.now()` nonce (worst in cancel-heavy DCA/grid rebalances, which fire many single-order cancels back to back). A per-signer monotonic nonce is now shared across all in-process clients, and nonce collisions are added to the retry set for both Hyperliquid and Kraken (combo-bot Kraken legs hit the same class via `EAPI:Invalid nonce`). Nonce rejections are pre-execution, so re-signing with a fresh, higher nonce is safe and cannot double-place or double-cancel. This removes the transient, self-recovering `botError` alerts users were getting for it.

### Changed

- Bitget spot candle reads now page the recent `/spot/market/candles` endpoint at its documented max of 1000 candles/call (was 200), while `/spot/market/history-candles` stays correctly capped at 200. Each range read that stays inside the recent-lookback window now issues ~5x fewer upstream requests, which is the dominant driver of the `Bitget request must sleep` rate-limit churn in the connector fleet (getSpotCandles was the single largest source). Chunk striding in the mixed recent/historic path advances by the page size of the endpoint each chunk uses, so no bars are skipped. Futures candles are unchanged (they use the 200-capped history endpoint; raising them requires an endpoint switch, tracked separately).

## [1.15.7] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Kraken spot `submitOrder` no longer reports a just-placed order as "Order not found in open orders". After a successful submit we hold the order's txid, so the post-submit confirmation now retries the exact `getSpotOrderByTxid` (QueryOrders) lookup a few times to ride out Kraken's brief read-after-write lag before ever falling back to the ambiguous userref path — and the final fallback prefers the txid so `getOrder` re-routes through the exact `isKrakenSpotTxid` lookup. Previously a single QueryOrders miss dropped straight to the userref lookup, where every Gainium client id collapses to one shared userref (`parseInt(id.slice(0,8),16)` stops at the first non-hex char, e.g. all `CMB-*` → 12), so a live order could not be matched and combo/grid/dca placement surfaced a false failure.

## [1.15.6] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid connection verification now rejects an **API/agent wallet address** entered in place of the main account address. HL signs orders with the agent key but executes them on the master account, while every info request (balance/positions/orders) targets the address stored on the connection — so an agent address verified "fine" (an empty balance is a valid response) yet left the bot blind to its own positions and fills: `unknownOid` on order read-back, deals frozen with no recorded entry, and (via base-order retries) doubled positions with no take-profit. `verifyHyperliquid` now calls HL `userRole` on the entered address and, when it resolves to `role: "agent"`, fails verification with a clear message naming the correct main account address to use.

### Reverted

- Reverted the 1.15.5 Hyperliquid numeric-`oid` fallback in `getOrder`. It was built on a misdiagnosis — the observed `unknownOid` reports were either transient cloid lag already handled by the existing retry, or (the real case) an agent address being queried, which no order-read fallback can fix. The fallback added latency on the failing path without resolving any real defect. `getOrder`/`openOrder` return to the 1.15.4 behaviour.

## [1.15.5] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid orders no longer surface a spurious `unknownOid` error for orders the exchange actually accepted. After placing an order, `getOrder` re-fetched it **by cloid** (`newClientOrderId`); under load HL's cloid→oid index lags, so `orderStatus` returned `unknownOid`, and once the retry window (~9.5s) was exhausted the error propagated to the bot even though the order had been placed (and often filled). The place response already returns HL's **authoritative numeric `oid`** synchronously — `openOrder` now captures it and `getOrder` falls back to querying by that oid (which resolves immediately) before giving up. Prior fixes only lengthened the cloid retry window; this removes the root cause.

## [1.15.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Kraken Futures now records the **actual average fill price** instead of the limit price. `getOrderStatus`/`getOrderEvents` only expose an order's `limitPrice`, so a limit order that filled better than its limit (common for marketable base orders) was reported at the worse limit price — understating deal P/L (e.g. entry booked at 63528 when Kraken filled at 63264, showing +$1.52 net where the real result was ~+$2.79). `getOrder` now fetches `getFills` for filled orders, computes the size-weighted average execution price, and passes it through as `avgPrice` + `price` + `cummulativeQuoteQty` so main-app's fill logic resolves the true entry on both the placement and poll/reconcile paths. Falls back to the limit price when no fills match (or on a transient `getFills` error), so order recording never breaks.

## [1.15.3] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Kraken Futures rate-limit (`{error:"apiLimitExceeded", httpStatus:429}`) is now retried with backoff. The retry list only had spot's `EAPI:Rate limit exceeded`, so futures 429s were thrown straight through and surfaced to users as an uncategorized `apiLimitExceeded`.

### Changed

- `futures_changeLeverage` / `futures_changeMarginType` now dedupe redundant `setLeverageSettings` calls via a process-level cache of the last confirmed leverage-preference per (account, symbol). Multi-pair futures bots re-set leverage/margin on every deal open, spraying the `leveragepreferences` endpoint across pairs and self-inflicting the 429s above. Cache writes only on confirmed success; 30-min TTL self-heals external changes.

## [1.15.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Kraken xStock live prices: `getAllPrices` now also fetches the tokenized Ticker (`asset_class: tokenized_asset`), so deals on Kraken stock pairs get a last/mark price (Kraken serves it even out of hours) instead of "Price unavailable" (which also blocked unrealized P&L / TP-SL).


## [1.15.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Kraken xStock fees: `getUserFees`/`getAllUserFees` now fetch the tokenized universe (`aclass: tokenized_asset`), so fees resolve for stock pairs (e.g. PGx-USD) instead of throwing "Pair not found" → "User fee not found".


## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Kraken spot now supports tokenized-equity ("xStocks") pairs (e.g. `AAPLx-USD`, `SPYx-USD`). Kraken hides these from the default `AssetPairs` response and rejects every per-pair call that omits the tokenized flag ("Unknown asset pair"), so none surfaced before. `getAllExchangeInfo` (spot) now makes a second `AssetPairs` call with `aclass: 'tokenized_asset'`, merges those pairs, tags each `assetClass: 'etf' | 'stock'` (ETF/index trackers curated in `KRAKEN_XSTOCK_ETFS`, everything else `'stock'`), and registers them via `KrakenSymbolMapper.setTokenized()`. Per-pair spot calls — `latestPrice` (Ticker), `getCandles` (OHLC), `getTrades` (RecentTrades) and `openOrder` (AddOrder) — inject `asset_class: 'tokenized_asset'` for tokenized symbols via `xstockParams()`. Param-name quirk preserved: `AssetPairs` uses `aclass`, all other calls use `asset_class`.
- ADDITIVE + flag-gated: enabled by default, disabled with `KRAKEN_XSTOCKS_ENABLED=false`, and skipped in demo/testnet. Ordinary crypto Kraken spot/futures pairs are unaffected — they carry no `assetClass` and never receive the `asset_class` param.

## [1.14.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Kraken spot `getOrder` now resolves a Kraken order txid via QueryOrders (guarded by txid-format detection). main-app already translates our client id to the stored txid before polling Kraken order status (reconcile / checkOrdersAfterReconnect), but the connector could only look up by userref (`parseInt('O…',16)=NaN`), so that path never resolved — resting Kraken spot fills were never reconciled. This repairs the missed-fill reconcile backstop for Kraken (forum #4890); pairs with main-app preserving the local clientOrderId in the merge.

## [1.14.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Kraken spot order placement re-fetched the just-placed order by userref, which collides across ALL Gainium client order ids (shared "D-…"/"GRID-…" prefixes all parse to the same int) — with ≥2 such orders on an account, an instantly-filled market order came back as a DIFFERENT resting order (open, 0 filled) and the fill was silently never registered on the deal. Now resolves by the Kraken txid via QueryOrders (exact, state-independent), falling back to the legacy lookup. Also report the average executed price (not descr.price, which is '0' for market orders) in QueryOrders/closed-orders results.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid futures balance under-reported total equity. `futures_getBalance` derived `locked` from `marginSummary.totalMarginUsed` (open-position margin only), so `free + locked = withdrawable + positionMargin` omitted the collateral HL reserves for OPEN ORDERS — a leveraged account with deep resting grid/DCA ladders showed far less than its real `accountValue` (e.g. $13.9k for a $20.8k account). Derive `locked = accountValue - free` (free = `min(withdrawable, accountValue)`) so total equals `accountValue`; still clamps `locked >= 0` and collapses the anomalous non-primary `accountValue=0` dex-state to zero (no phantom balance).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Hyperliquid spot: emit `isCanonical` per pair (HL-canonical or Unit-bridged = true; permissionless HIP-1 = false) for the dashboard "Canonical only" pair-picker filter.

### Changed

- Hyperliquid spot: stop hiding permissionless TradFi-namesquat tokens; surface every pair and let the dashboard filter/classify them. Equity/RWA spot tokens are still classified via `perpCategories`.

## [1.13.4] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Hyperliquid `spot_getBalance` now clamps a negative spot `hold` to `0`. Hyperliquid can return a negative `hold` on spot-perp / builder-dex wallets (observed live: USDC `total=59953 hold=-85125`, USDT0 `total=0 hold=-89572`); the old `free = total - hold` inflated `free` by the absolute hold (USDC showed `145078` instead of the real `59953`, USDT a phantom `89572`) and `locked = hold` went negative. Now `locked = max(0, hold)` and `free = max(0, total - locked)`, so `free + locked === total` and neither value is phantom. This is the true source of the wrong Hyperliquid free/locked seen in the dashboard; the earlier `futures_getBalance` and main-app `normalizeLocked` fixes addressed the negative-`locked` symptom but not the inflated spot `free`.

## [1.13.3] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Hyperliquid `futures_getBalance` now also bounds `free` by the dex-state's own value — `min(withdrawable, accountValue - locked)` — instead of the raw account-level `withdrawable`. Prevents a phantom balance (e.g. USDT `free=89568` on a state whose `accountValue=0`) from surfacing the account total under a non-primary collateral asset. No change for healthy single-collateral accounts where `withdrawable ≤ accountValue - marginUsed`.

## [1.13.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Hyperliquid `futures_getBalance` now derives `locked` from `marginSummary.totalMarginUsed` (per-collateral, always ≥ 0) instead of `accountValue - withdrawable`, which produced a negative `locked` whenever an account-level `withdrawable` exceeded a given dex-state's `accountValue` (e.g. a non-primary collateral reading `accountValue=0`). Fixes negative locked balances propagating to the `balances` collection and wrong "available" display.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Binance.US API-key verification now hits the spot `GET /api/v3/account` (`getAccountInformation`) instead of the Binance.com-only `GET /sapi/v1/account/info` (`getAccountInfo`), which 404s on Binance.US. Every Binance.US key was being rejected as invalid regardless of its actual validity/permissions.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Hyperliquid: all Unit-bridged spot bases now normalize to their canonical ticker (`UETH→ETH`, `USOL→SOL`, … — previously only `UBTC→BTC`), derived authoritatively from `spotMeta` `fullName` with a collision guard (`UPUMP`/`UMOG`/`UUUSPX` stay raw). Both the display pair and the wallet balance asset are normalized, and the raw Unit pair is dual-registered so bots created before the change still resolve.

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid: spot balances now reconcile to the pair base (`UBTC` wallet asset → `BTC`), so SELL side and bot funds no longer read 0 for spot holdings (forum #4860), for every Unit token — not just BTC.

### Removed

- Hyperliquid: un-curated HIP-1 permissionless spot tokens that namesquat a TradFi ticker (`AAPL`, `TSLA`, `MSFT`, … — one-genesis-address synthetics with near-zero depth) are now hidden from the spot listing. The real, curated equity exposure is the HIP-3 perp, classified on the perp path.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- OKX Europe (`okxsource=my` → eea.okx.com) authoritative spot instruments. New `GET /exchange/account` endpoint + `OKXExchange.getAccountSpotExchangeInfo()` hit the authenticated, account-scoped `/api/v5/account/instruments` and return the account's real tradeable universe (USDC/EUR spot) — the public feed still advertises the global USDT set EU accounts cannot trade. The instrument→`ExchangeInfo` mapper is now shared between the public and account-scoped paths. Non-OKX exchanges resolve to a "not supported" default.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Binance/Binance.US API-key verification now reports the exchange's real rejection (`code` + message from the client's `.body`/`.response.data`) instead of the useless `Binance us catch [object Object]`. Add-exchange failures for Binance.US were unreadable in the logs, hiding whether the cause was the key, permissions, or IP.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Authoritative `assetClass` for **Binance** USDⓈ-M TradFi-Perps, read from the exchange's own `underlyingType` in `getAllExchangeInfo`: `EQUITY`/`KR_EQUITY`/`PREMARKET` → `stock` (an `ETF` subtype → `etf`), `COMMODITY` → `commodity`. `COIN` and Binance's crypto composite `INDEX` (BTCDOM/DEFI/ALL) stay crypto, so existing pairs are untouched. Lets stock/commodity symbols surface under their own asset class downstream.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Authoritative `assetClass` for **Hyperliquid** HIP-3 builder-dex (TradFi) perps from its own `perpCategories` info endpoint: `stocks`/`preipo` → `stock`, `commodities` → `commodity`, `indices` → `index`, `fx` → `forex`. Crypto/native perps stay crypto. (Supersedes the 1.9.0 note that Hyperliquid exposes no signal — the signal lives in the separate `perpCategories` endpoint, keyed by `dex:ASSET`.)

### Changed
- Bitget **SPOT** tokenized stocks (reality tokens `rTSLA`/`rAAPL`/…, v3 `symbolType: stock`) are now **excluded** from spot exchange-info — they are not tradeable through Bitget's API yet, so surfacing them as tradeable pairs was misleading. Re-enable by removing the filter in `spot_getAllExchangeInfo` once Bitget supports API trading for reality stocks. Metals (PAXG/XAUT) are unaffected.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Authoritative `assetClass` extended to **Bybit** and **Kraken** (same no-heuristics rule as Bitget):
  - Bybit reads its own `symbolType` from v5 instruments-info — spot tokenized equities (`xstocks`) → `stock`; linear perps `stock` → `stock` and `commodity` → `commodity` (Bybit's own label for oil/XAU/XAG, kept verbatim).
  - Kraken Futures reads its own `category` from `/derivatives/api/v3/instruments` — `xStocks`/`Pre-IPO` → `stock`, `Forex` → `forex`, `Commodities` → `commodity`. Kraken's crypto buckets (`Real-world assets`, `DTF`, Layer 1/DeFi/…) stay crypto; Kraken **spot** exposes no class signal (`aclass_base` is uniformly `currency`) so it stays crypto.
- Investigated and left crypto (no authoritative TradFi field exposed): OKX (`instCategory` is a fee tier; `pre_market` is crypto), Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Hyperliquid.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Authoritative asset class per symbol on `ExchangeInfo` (`assetClass`: crypto/stock/etf/commodity/metal/forex/index). Bitget populates it from the unified v3 instruments endpoint (`symbolType`) for both spot and futures — no heuristics. Other exchanges leave it unset (default crypto downstream).

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Kraken Futures hedge mode now reports one-way/netting (`getHedge` → false) instead of a hardcoded `true`, which had permanently blocked neutral futures grid bots with "Bot cannot run in hedge mode"
- Kraken spot `submitOrder` re-resolves the just-placed order by its client order id instead of the Kraken txid, so a resting limit order placed below market is no longer wrongly closed with "Order not found in open orders"

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- Binance spot rebate now queries the apiReferral endpoint (`sapi/v1/apiReferral/rebate/recentRecord`) instead of the sub-account broker endpoint, so records carry orderId/email and can be attributed to users

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Hyperliquid balance 422 error retry and log

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Self-hosted admin-config sync (gated by `ADMIN_CONFIG_ENABLED`). Reads
  `gainium:admin:enabled_exchanges` from Redis, subscribes to
  `gainium:admin:config` pubsub for sub-second propagation, and runs a
  10s periodic refresh as a safety net for dropped messages. When the
  flag is off (cloud / unflagged deployments) every code path is a hard
  no-op — no Redis connection opened, no timers, no log lines.
